    If you think you already have an Bookistha account, and you were just trying to associate a new authentication with your existing account, then you’re in the wrong place. You’re not logged into Bookistha right now.

    If you have a Bookistha account, and you’d like to associate another authentication with it, here’s what to do:
  %ul.small
    %li Log in in to Bookistha with your existing authentication service TODO
    %li
      Go to your settings page (located at the top/right corner of the page)
      %li Add one or more accounts to be used to sign-in
